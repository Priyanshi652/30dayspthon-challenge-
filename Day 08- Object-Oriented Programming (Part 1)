🗒️ Topics
- Classes, objects, methods, attributes

🎯 Challenge
- Create a Car class with attributes and a display method


# 🚗 Let's build a cool Car class in Python!
# This class will store basic details about a car and print them in a fun, stylish way.

class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, brand, year, fuel_capacity, mileage):
        # When we create a new car, we want to remember its basic details
        self.model = model               
        self.brand = brand              
        self.year = year               
        self.fuel_capacity = fuel_capacity  
        self.mileage = mileage           

        print(f"\n🎉 A New Car Has Been Created! 🎉")

    def display_attributes(self):
        # This method will print all the car details in a stylish way
        print("\n🚘✨ Here Are the Car's Super Specs! ✨🚘")
        print("========================================")
        print(f"🆔  Brand            : {self.brand}")      
        print(f"🏷️  Model            : {self.model}")        
        print(f"📅  Year             : {self.year}")         
        print(f"⛽  Fuel Capacity    : {self.fuel_capacity} Liters")  
        print(f"📏  Mileage          : {self.mileage} km/l")         
        print("========================================")
        print("🔧 Ready to hit the road in style! 🔧")


# 🔧 Time to create our car! Let's give it some values.
my_car = Car("Fortuner Legender", "Toyota", 2024, 80, 14)

# 🖨️ Now let's display all those cool specs we just set.
my_car.display_attributes()
