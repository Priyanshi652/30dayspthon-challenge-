🎯 Challenge

# 📂 Ask the user to enter the filename (it should be in the same folder)
file_name = input('📂 Enter the file name: ')
try:
    # 🗂️ Try opening the file
    open_file = open(file_name)
    
    # 🧮 Create an empty dictionary to store word counts
    counts = dict()
    
    # 📄 Go through each line in the file
    for line in open_file:
        # ✂️ Split the line into individual words
        words = line.split()
        
        # 🔁 Count each word
        for word in words:
            if word in counts:
                counts[word] += 1  # ➕ Add 1 if the word already exists
            else:
                counts[word] = 1   # 🆕 If new word, set count to 1

    # 📊 Print a nicely formatted report
    print("=" * 50)
    print("📊 Word Frequency Report:")
    print("=" * 50)
    print("\n")
    
    print("Here’s the count of each word found in your file:")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    # 📌 Display each word and how many times it appeared
    for word in counts:
        print(f"{word} → {counts[word]}")   
    
    print("\n")    
    print("=" * 50)
    print("🎉 Analysis complete! Thanks for checking your word counts.")
    print("=" * 50)

# 🚫 Handle the case where the file couldn't be opened
except:
    print('❌ File cannot be opened:', file_name)
