Day 0️⃣5️⃣: Functions

🎯 Challenge
- Write a function that computes the sum and average of a list of numbers

#definig a function
def sum_and_average(list):
    print("=" * 80)
    print("🔍 Calculating the sum and average of your given numbers-:")
    print("=" * 80)

    #checking if the list of numbers are empty or not
    if list == []:
        print("\n🚫oops! You gave me an empty list of numbers!\n")
        return 0
    else:
        total = sum({number for number in list})
        total_number_count = len(list)
        average = total/total_number_count
    
    print(f"\n ✅The total length of list is : {total_number_count} \n")
    print(f"🧮 The sum of your numbers is: {total}")
    print(f"📊 The average is: {average:.2f}")
    
    return total,average

user_input = [12,4,13,29,71,8]
total,avg = sum_and_average(user_input)
